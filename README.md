## ` Question 6: How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?`

**Answer:**

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript**. It is an object-oriented programming language built on top of JavaScript with additional features. It adds powerful tools like **static typing**, **better editor support**, and **compile-time error checking** all of which help developers improve code quality and maintainability.

### TypeScript improves your code in many ways:

âœ… Catches errors while coding instead of waiting until runtime  
âœ… Shows helpful code suggestions and auto-complete in the editor  
âœ… Allows safe and easy code refactoring  
âœ… Handles big projects well that makes managing large codebases easier  
âœ… Supports large projects with better structure and scalability  
âœ… Ensures cleaner and more readable code with strong typing

TypeScript works like a smart helper. It makes sure your code is correct and easy to manage. This helps you build projects faster and with more confidence.

## ` Question 1: What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?`

**Answer:**

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` are tools to describe the shape of data that mainly objects but they work a bit differently and are useful in different cases.

### `interface`

- Used to **define the structure of an object** (what properties it should have).
- Can be **extended** using the extends keyword
- Mostly used when describing **object blueprints**.

### `type`

- Can be used for **object types** as well as **primitives** (string, number, etc.), **unions**, **intersections**, etc.
- Helps to create **shortcuts or aliases** for complex types.

ðŸŸ¨ **For Example:**

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type ID = number | string;
```
